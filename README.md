# Clean-empty-folders-unity-plugin

___________________________

The purpose of this script is to aid in keeping your working directories clean and pevent accidental commits of unwanted files.

Adds a dropdown option within Unity's Editor to allow the user to one-click delete 'emptyâ€™ folders that are still lingering due to a .meta file

Based on the script by [unity3dcollege](https://gist.github.com/unity3dcollege)
with great additions from [Brandon-Gui123](https://github.com/Brandon-Gui123), and including my own changes.
